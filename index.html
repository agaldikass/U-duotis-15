      <p>Audi stands for sporty vehicles, premium workmanship    and progressive design – for “Vorsprung durch Technik”. Founded in 1899 by August Horch, the Audi Group – which also unites the Bentley, Ducati and Lamborghini brands under one roof – is currently one of the most successful manufacturers of automobiles and motorcycles in the premium segment. <br><br>

        In 2021, the Audi Group delivered around 1.681 million cars from the Audi brand, 8,405 sports cars from the Lamborghini brand and 59,447 motorcycles from the Ducati brand to customers. In the 2021 fiscal year, AUDI AG achieved total revenue of €53.1 billion and an operating profit before special items of €5.5 billion. More than 85,000 people all over the world work for the Audi Group, around 58,000 of them in Germany. With its attractive brands, new models, innovative mobility offerings and groundbreaking services, the premium brand group is systematically pursuing its path toward becoming a provider of sustainable, individual, premium mobility. <br><br>
        
        Innovations like quattro permanent all-wheel drive are a part of Audi’s DNA. With the decision only to launch fully electric models on the global market starting in 2026, Audi is once again taking the lead, pursuing a clear strategy for an electric, digital and fully connected future. By 2026, Audi plans to have more than 20 fully electric models on offer. <br><br>
        
        This clear commitment to electromobility is the cornerstone of Audi’s sustainability strategy. Based on this, Audi considers sustainability along the entire value chain, takes responsibility for the environment and society and makes sustainable corporate governance an inherent component of all its decisions and products.</p>

      <p>BMW, in full Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, German automaker noted for quality sports sedans and motorcycles. Headquarters are in Munich. <br><br>

        It originated in 1916 as Bayerische Flugzeug-Werke, a builder of aircraft engines, but assumed the name Bayerische Motoren Werke in July 1917 and began producing motorcycles in the 1920s. BMW entered the automobile business in 1928. The company’s R32 motorcycle set a world speed record that was not broken until 1937. During World War II BMW built the world’s first jet airplane engines, used by the Luftwaffe, Germany’s air force. After the war the company tried to move into the small-car market but found that it could not compete effectively against Volkswagen’s compact, inexpensive autos. By 1959 the company was on the verge of bankruptcy, and its managers were planning to sell the firm to Daimler-Benz. <br><br>
        
        In that year, however, BMW pulled out of its financial slump; German entrepreneur Herbert Quandt acquired a controlling interest in the firm, and BMW introduced its 700 series, soon followed by the equally successful 1500 model. At about the same time, the company introduced a new series of motorcycles that were particularly popular in the United States. <br><br>
        
        BMW was firmly established as a premium automobile brand by the end of the 20th century. In a failed attempt to gain market share as a sport-utility vehicle company, BMW purchased the Rover Group in 1994 but lost roughly $4 billion before selling the Land Rover brand to Ford in 2000. BMW saw great success with the relaunch of the British MINI in 2001, however, and another British brand, Rolls-Royce, became part of BMW in 2003. Members of the Quandt family continued to hold a significant stake in the company.</p>

      <p> Mercedes-Benz is a subsidiary of Daimler and the brand is used on luxury cars, buses and trucks. Mercedes focuses its sponsorship spending on events that attract a well-heeled crowd. Its three pillars are golf, tennis and New York’s Fashion Week. Last year, it jumped into football with a 10-year stadium naming rights deal for the Superdome in New Orleans worth an estimated $50 million to $60 million.” <br><br>
        Mercedes-Benz traces its origins to Karl Benz’s creation of the first petrol-powered car, the Benz Patent Motorwagen, financed by Bertha Benz and patented in January 1886, and Gottlieb Daimler and engineer Wilhelm Maybach’s conversion of a stagecoach by the addition of a petrol engine later that year. The Mercedes automobile was first marketed in 1901 by Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft. The first Mercedes-Benz brand name vehicles were produced in 1926, following the merger of Karl Benz’s and Gottlieb Daimler’s companies into the Daimler-Benz company.Throughout the 1930s, Mercedes-Benz produced the 770 model, a car that was popular during Germany’s Nazi period. Adolf Hitler was known to have driven these cars during his time in power, with bulletproof windshields. Most of the surviving models have been sold at auctions to private buyers. One of them is currently on display at the War Museum in Ottawa, Ontario. Mercedes-Benz has introduced many technological and safetyinnovations that later became common in other vehicles. Mercedes-Benz is one of the best known and established automotive brands in the world, and is also one of the world’s oldest automotive brand still in existence today in 2014, having produced the first petrol-powered car.</p>
